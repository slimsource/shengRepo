Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose 
programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and 
first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy 
emphasizes code readability with its notable use of 
significant whitespace. Its language constructs and 
object-oriented approach aim to help programmers 
write clear, logical code for small and large-scale 
projects.

Python is meant to be an easily readable language. 
Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often 
uses English keywords where other languages use 
punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does 
not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and 
semicolons after statements are optional.
